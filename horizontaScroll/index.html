            <p>Describing its association with daily life situations, I have found an article that about the effect of

            <h1>How?</h1>
            <p class="fadein">The article presents the information about the effects of discrimination in the workplace and in the
                employee mental and physical health. This information has been presented and analysed through a study
                reviewed by NIH, which shows that discrimination can lead to many unhealth habits such as smoking and
                heavy alcohol use. It also presents that the employees losses focus and exhibit counterproductive work
                behaviours, or not completing tasks on time, leaving work early and arriving late. This article has an
                extreme importance since people sometimes don't realise its impact either on the employee or in the
                workplace.

            <p class="fadein">This article mostly links to the concept of discrimination in the working eviroment. Since we have been
                reading and talking about racism and other forms of discriminations in the past classes, I think it's
                important to link it to the daily activities and environments we have, for example the school or as the
                example of the article, the workplace.

            <p class="fadein">With this, I was able to noticed the importance of knowing about discrimination and its real world
                impacts in our daily lives. I first by just looking at the title thoght that the article was about how
                boxes discriminate their workers, however later on I noticed that I was actually the discrimination
                between workers. I also learned that people can interpret the title of an article with different
                perspectives, and the only way of knowing what it is about is by actually reading it.</p>

                    <p class="fadein">Words. I have never seen such a video that is able to generate such an impact with its words. We
                        have talked about bullying, we have talked about discrimination and beauty. This video in a
                        matter of seconds was able to grab my attention for a reason and after 2 minutes it made me stay
                        in the video for another. It's words and cartoons make it incredible to watch and something
                        where you can't take your eyes off, and that's why I choose to talk about this.</p>

                    <p class="fadein">This video has its main goal to use 'words' and animations to show that "Words may hurt more than
                        sticks and stones." This information is presented in a persuasive and intriguing way throughout
                        the video. Because of its impact with its words and cartoons, it makes it easy for the viewer to
                        understand the meaning behind. This has a huge importance for every person, since it talks about
                        a daily life situation where not many people seem to realize what happens.

                    <p class="fadein">"To This Day" is a spoken word poem written by Shane Koyczan. In the poem Koyczan talks about
                        bullying and other forms of spoken agrecissons received during their lives and its deep,
                        long-term impact.</p>

                    <p class="fadein" >In this analysis I learned 3 main things. First, in order to show a clear message, the content is
                        as important as the way it is presented, since that's what will make an impact on the view.
                        Secondly beauty and bullying is a concept where in the majority of the time goes together, when
                        looking from a broad perspective of beauty. And thirdly, words can have a huge impact on
                        someone, either in a good or bad way, when spoken correctly.

                    new identity for ourselves. We discussed this as a class by reading the bluest eye. While
                    researching it, I found an article answering this question.

                <p class="fadein">This article briefly presents the question and answers it by breaking it down into what each of these
                    two words mean. It talks about the meaning of culture and identity and their meaning together.

                Before reading the article, I never truly understood the meaning of these two words combined. I learned
                that culture includes traditions, values, norms, food, religion. that make up the lifestyle of a
                society. However, our identity is the impact of culture and society. It is the being who or what a
                person or thing is. The article discusses that the way in which culture influences our identity is by
                indirectly showing us the habits of a culture, for example, the style of clothing or its religion, thus
                not changing but implementing it into our identity.
