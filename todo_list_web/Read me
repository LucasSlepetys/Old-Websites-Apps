In order to open this website, 
--> open chrome (or any other browser), 
--> click "cmd" + "space",
--> search "navigations.html" (make sure you start on this specific page!),
--> and double click it. Or drag it to your browser.

-------

There is no need for installing any third party modules in order to run this website --->
However, make sure you have the WiFi on! Since it uses modules and packages such as Jquery, to run the website. (Which comes from your browser!)

All modules are already imported to each HTML page by using the '<script src="">' tag and are ready to run as soon as it is requested to do so on the website.
(Make sure you have your WiFi turned on!)

-------
Extra information:
-------

The website contains only 2 pages. -->
* The first page is a navigation menu (which contains 2 links which acts as buttons and a <p> tag which acts as a title) 

* Moving to the second page, it contains all the rest of the input and tags needed for the website to form a TODO-List web application. 
* Even though, the website only contains 2 pages, it still acts up as a 5 page website. {
    - I have used Jquery in most of the javascript files/parts, since it allows me to write javascript in fewer lines.
    - I made functions which allows me to remove elements from the screen and add new alements to it in less than a second, to form the impression of multiple pages + a faster loading.
}

* The website contains at least one of each of the required input/elements {
    - Textbox
    - Checkbox
    - Radio button
    - Drop down menu
    - Multiple selection box
    - Button
    - Textarea
    - Table
}

Note:

* I could not implement the "smtpjs" email system in order to send a email, since I was not able to create a token for my email. --->
However, I sent a email to my self showing how the email would look like. And I have inserted the image on the last "page"/part of the website. (Name of the file: "email.png")

Thank you very much!
